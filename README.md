# Project 3: Arcade Game

## About this project
This is the third project in the [Udacity Front End Nanodegree course](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The objective was to use the provided visual assets and a game loop engine to create a Frogger-like game.

## How to load the game
You can either download the repository and open **index.html** in your web browser. Or you open the game that is [hosted on Github Pages](http://gregdavenportdesign.com/udacity-project-3-arcade-game/).

## Objective
Move the player from the bottom of the board to reach the water. Avoid the ladybugs. If you touch a ladybug you will be sent back to the beginning. When you reach the water, the game is reset. Play again!

## Controls
A keyboard is required. Use the arrow keys to control the player.
